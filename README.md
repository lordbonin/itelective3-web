## Order System

Order management starts when a customer places an order and ends once they receive their package or service. It allows a business to coordinate the entire fulfillment process — from order collection, inventory and delivery visibility to service availability. There are also a digital way to manage the lifecycle of an order. It tracks all the information and processes, including order entry, inventory management, fulfillment and after-sales service. An order system offers visibility to both the business and the buyer. Organizations can have near real-time insight into inventories and customers can check when an order will arrive. The workflow involved can differ based on a company’s needs, but a typical order management process includes different steps:

* Placement

	The customer places the order through an automated form. A sales team member checks the details and confirms the order.
	
* Fulfillment

	A warehouse employee confirms shipping details, generates an invoice and fulfills the order — pick, pack and ship.

* Inventory Management

	Inventory levels are monitored as they fluctuate with the demands of the business.
